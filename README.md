# Project Repository
# Description
This repository contains six distinct projects organized into separate folders. Each project focuses on a unique problem-solving or development task, ranging from video processing and AI-based applications to interactive visualization tools and even games. The repository serves as a showcase for diverse technologies, programming techniques, and design principles.

Each folder in the repository represents a standalone project, complete with its own codebase, documentation, and resources.

# Repository Structure
## 1. Midterm
- Project Name: TumorScent
- Description:
  - TumorScent is a fictional imaging technique that breaks the boundaries of physics by inventing a revolutionary method for cancer detection based on scent. This speculative project envisions leveraging advanced theoretical principles to capture and analyze scent patterns emitted by cancerous tissues, enabling a non-invasive and ultra-sensitive diagnostic tool.

  - YOLO Player Tracker:
    - Real-time player detection and tracking using YOLOv8.
    - Generates annotated videos with player IDs and bounding boxes.
    - Visualizes positional heatmaps using homography.
  - Image Classifier:
    - Custom dataset support with preprocessing.
    - Training pipeline for multi-class classification.
    - TensorFlow-based deep learning model.
- Technologies: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Tkinter.
- Readme: Task2 README
## 4. Task3
- Project Name: 3D Brain Puzzle Game
- Description:
  - A Unity-based 3D puzzle game where players reconstruct a scattered brain by moving and rotating individual parts. The game promotes spatial awareness and problem-solving skills through an engaging and interactive experience.
- Key Features:
  - Drag-and-rotate mechanics for assembling brain parts.
  - Realistic 3D models with high-quality textures.
  - Dynamic camera controls for 360Â° exploration of the puzzle.
  - Progress tracking and achievements for completing the puzzle efficiently.
- Technologies: Unity, C#, Blender
- Readme: Task3 README
## 5. Task4
- Project Name:  DICOM Viewer
- Description:
  - A feature-rich application for loading, viewing, and interacting with DICOM medical images. The project supports displaying single-frame and multi-frame DICOM files, viewing metadata, anonymizing sensitive patient data, and generating 3D slice layouts.
- Key Features:
  - Image Viewer:
    - Supports single-frame and multi-frame DICOM files.
    - Real-time image adjustments (brightness, contrast, zoom).
  - Metadata Viewer:
    - Displays DICOM tags and allows anonymization of sensitive data.
  - 3D Viewer:
    - Visualizes DICOM slices in a tiled layout for detailed analysis.
Technologies: Python, Tkinter, pydicom, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Readme: Task4 README
