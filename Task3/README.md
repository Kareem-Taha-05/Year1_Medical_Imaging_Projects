# 3D Brain Puzzle Game

# Description
The 3D Brain Puzzle Game challenges players to reconstruct a scattered brain by moving and rotating individual parts. Players must align and assemble the pieces into a complete brain structure. This interactive and engaging game combines problem-solving and spatial awareness, offering an immersive 3D puzzle-solving experience.

Built using Unity, the game leverages 3D physics, intuitive controls, and visually appealing assets to create an educational and entertaining experience.
